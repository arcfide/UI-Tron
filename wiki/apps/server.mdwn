# Server Development Log #

## Description ##

This page is for the description and tracking of the development status
and needs of the main server application.

## Architecture Decisions ##

Initially, we are prototyping the server in APL. See the [[protocol]]
page for information about the protocol for the server.

We are going with a simple fork-and-run model for the moment, though we
probably want to improve this in the future if a lot of games get
running.
