			# Tron API # 
			############

The main artifact of the IU Tron project is currently the Tron API,
which is a Scheme library suitable for running tron games locally,
and for communicating to a remote server.

As of version 1.0, only the local play and textual display is
implemented.

Obtaining the Tron API 
----------------------

It is easiest to grab the code from the current repository. Just 
run:

	git clone git://github.com/arcfide/UI-Tron.git

You should now have an IU-Tron directory.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you are building the Tron API from Source, then you will need 
ChezWEB 2.0 or better.

	http://www.sacrideo.us/v5/proj/chezweb/

If you are using one of the pre-tangled libraries, then you should 
be able to use any current version of Chez Scheme, though the system 
is tested on versions greater than 8.4. 

If you are on an IU administered public system like tank or silo then 
ChezWEB is installed already. You can enable ChezWEB by 
running the following commands:

	ln -sf /nobackup/awhsu/ChezWEB/cheztangle ~/bin/cheztangle
	ln -sf /nobackup/awhsu/ChezWEB/chezweave ~/bin/chezweave

Building
--------

After you have installed ChezWEB, you can run 'make' in the src/ directory 
and it will build tronapi.ss and tronapi.pdf. tronapi.ss is the file 
that you will load or import into Scheme, while tronapi.pdf is the code 
listing and documentation that you will want to read. 

Documentation
-------------

The Tron API is a literate program, and as a program API, most of the 
important things are documented in the source itself. If documentation 
or usage questions arise that are not covered by the tronapi.pdf document, 
please file an issue so that we can address it.
