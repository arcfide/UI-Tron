# Tron API 

The main artifact of the IU Tron project is currently the Tron API,
which is a Scheme library suitable for running tron games locally,
and for communicating to a remote server.

As of version 1.0, only the local play and textual display is
implemented.

# Obtaining the Tron API

# Prerequisites

If you are building the Tron API from Source, then you will need 
ChezWEB 2.0 or better.

If you are using one of the pre-tangled libraries, then you should 
be able to use any current version of Chez Scheme, though the system 
is tested on versions greater than 8.1. 

# Documentation

The Tron API is a literate program, and as a program API, most of the 
important things are documented in the source itself. A woven version 
of the source should be available separately as a PDF document 
from the main Tron Downloads page listed above.
